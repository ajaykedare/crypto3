\section*{1. Re-design the Needham-Schroeder protocol to use as few messages as possible. Prove
informally that your protocol is secure.
If you could use timestamps in lieu of ( or in addition to nonces), what is the smallest
number of messages you need to achieve the same functionality provided by the
Needham-Schroeder protocol? Show your new design.}


\section*{2. Study the following attacks on SSL or on OpenSSL – BEAST, Heartbleed, Fluke. For each
attack answer the following:
What does the attack accomplish?
Desribe a ‘typical” attack scenario.
What is the vulnerability behind the attack?
How can the attack be defended against?}
